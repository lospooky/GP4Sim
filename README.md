# GP4Sim

GP4Sim is a series of plugins for the [HeuristicLab](http://dev.heuristiclab.com) optimization environment.
They introduce three features:
* Classes for the implementation of Genetic Programming optimzation problems within HeuristicLab, complementing the implementations for regression and classification problems HL offers out of the box.
* A ready-to-use HL implementation for evolving genetic programming financial trading strategies 
* An Interpreter for GP trees making use of the C# Expression Tree feature
<p>
GP4Sim is entirely developed in C# and is intended to run on Windows systems only, just like HeuristicLab.<br>
It requires .NET 4.5 or greater and HeuristicLab 3.3.13.<br>
</p>

## Installation

### Prerequisites
* .NET 4.5
* [HeuristicLab](http://dev.heuristiclab.com)

### From Sources
* [Download] (https://github.com/lospooky/GP4Sim/archive/master.zip) the source OR clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/lospooky/GP4Sim.git`
* Open GP4Sim.sln with Visual Studio 2015 and for all packages fix the HeuristicLab references according to the path HeuristicLab is installed on your system
* Build
* Copy all the compiled .dlls in your `HeuristicLab/bin` directory

### From Binaries
* [Download](https://github.com/lospooky/GP4Sim/releases/download/v1.0/GP4Sim-v1.0.zip) the compiled binaries, unzip and place in your HeuristicLab installation directory

## Usage

First of all make sure HeuristicLab is detecting the GP4Sim plugins by checking HL's Plugin Manager<br>
GP4Sim plugins should appear in there

### Symbolic Trading Problem
From HeuristicLab, New Problem -> GP4Sim Symbolic Trading Problem<br>
Explore and select available solution evaluators for trading problems:<br> 
Problem Pane -> Evaluator Node -> Set Value (Pencil)

### Symbolic Tree Expression Tree Interpreter
From any problem type using symbolic trees, e.g. the built-in Symbolic Regression / Symbolic Classification problems, flag the Show Hiddden Parameters box<br>
SymbolicExpressionTreeInterpreter -> Set Value (Pencil) -> Select GP4Sim SymbolicStateExpressionTreeInterpreter

### Implement your own GP Simulation Problem Type
Build on top of the GP4Sim packages, just like I did for the Trading Problem
