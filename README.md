# GP4Sim

GP4Sim is a series of plugins for the [HeuristicLab](http://dev.heuristiclab.com) optimization environment.
They introduce three features:
* Classes for the implementation of Genetic Programming optimzation problems within HeuristicLab, complementing the implementations for regression and classification problems HL offers out of the box.
* A ready-to-use HL implementation for evolving genetic programming financial trading strategies 
* An Interpreter for GP trees making use of the C# Expression Tree feature
<p>
GP4Sim is entirely developed in C# and is intended to run on Windows systems only, just like HeuristicLab.<br>
It requires .NET 4.5 or greater and HeuristicLab 3.3.13.<br>
</p>
